Post explaining how to split out one file in to multiple https://realguess.net/2014/05/18/split-a-large-json-file-into-smaller-pieces/

Install this https://stedolan.github.io/jq/

Use this to create json from CSV http://www.csvjson.com/csv2json

Run this in terminal

jq -cr 'keys[] as $k | "\($k)\n\(.[$k])"' data.json |
  while read -r key ; do
    read -r item
    printf "%s\n" "$item" > "lib/projects/$key.json"
  done
