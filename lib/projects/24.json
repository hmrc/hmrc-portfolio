{"id":28,"name":"Repayments (PAYE)","description":"This service is to allow customer to have money owed to them to be paid into their bank accounts via BACS transfer. This first release will support P800 Tax Refunds and is due to go live 1st Aug. The customer will receive a paper P800 and an invite to log into the Tax Platform. On login the customer will land on the P800 page which will show them the calculation to support the over payment. At the same time the P800 page will make a status request to the Get FTH API. If the payment is eligible for BACS the customer will enter the Repayment service and will provide their Bank Account number and if necessary the address that the bank knows. These details are passed to the Bank Reputation Service to validate to Bank account which is then checked against the SWORD database via EDH. If EDH tells us to \"Pay\" the Bank details are sent to the Claim API and the payment id processed. If we get a \"Don't Pay\" the NPI payment is suspended and a work item is created via PEGA.","theme":"Individuals","location":"Newcastle","phase":"public-beta","priority":"high","PTA/BTA":"PTA","product_manager":"Steve Richardson","interaction_designer":"Jen Rahman","user_researcher":"Paul Welsh / Cay Green","content_design":"Kieron Wyatt","frontend_dev":"Rob Lavender","short_name":"","users_sessions_last_90_days":"101,839.00","service_url":"https://www.tax.service.gov.uk/repayments/whose-account","Screenshots_of_this_service":""}
